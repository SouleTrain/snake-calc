# snake-calc
My current goal is to make a calculator from scratch only using python and perhaps external software for a GUI in the future

im starting off with a template designed by me with the help of gemnini and planning
to recode it from the ground up by myself, I started off with my own code and essentially just
asked gemini "hey why doesn't this work" or "what module could i import to help me do this", things like that.
i'm not very familar with regex yet so gemini was a big help with that.
